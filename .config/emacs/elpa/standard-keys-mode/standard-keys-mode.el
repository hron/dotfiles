;;; Commentary:

;; This packages is yet another cua-like mode, which emulates the
;; standard and common keybindings from modern editors (cut: C-x,
;; copy: C-c, redo: C-y, undo: C-z ...), similar to other packages
;; such as: cua-mode (built-in), ergoemacs-mode and wakib-keys.
;;
;; It rebinds the classic C-c and C-x key prefixes to other
;; keys (C-e and C-d respectively); this can be set to other key
;; prefix you prefer.
;;
;; This package includes some keymap template/themes out-the-box to
;; emulate different editors or modes without having to spend time
;; modifying them.
;;
;; Also this offers some additional functions:
;;
;; - `standard-keys-newline-and-indent-before-point'
;; - `standard-keys-move-beginning-of-line-or-indentation'
;; - `standard-keys-create-new-buffer'
;;
;; Thanks to Abdulla Bubshait (darkstego) for creating wakib-key,
;; which was the inspiration for this package.
